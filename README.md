# Frontend War Codeshow

Dear warriors of React, Vue, and Angular clan,

You are assigned to the ultimate mission that will determine the future of your clan. Please find the mission briefing below.

1. Let's compare our clan's repository with other enemy's repository
2. You must build a page that calls magical [GitHub's API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) and compare stats between clans (stars count, open issues count, forks count, pull requests count)
3. Clicking on the stars count number, navigate to another page that shows profile pictures of accounts that stars the repositories (those are the enemies, ELIMINATE THEM!!!).
4. Load more pictures using infinite scroll technique. (MORE ENEMIES!!!)

With this ultimate tool, you will be able to locate allies and enemies. Then your clan will rule the Frontend World.
